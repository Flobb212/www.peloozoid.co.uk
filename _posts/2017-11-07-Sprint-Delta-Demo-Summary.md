It's now been a whole week since our demo and a lot of improvements and changes have been made as a result. Overall reception of the concept and demo we provided was positive which was very uplifting, however there were still issues people had and that we've spent the last week sorting out. The main complaint many users made was how we temporarily implemented the replay controls. Initially we were using a sphere object to commence replay but for the demo we wanted the user to be able to do it at any point without an object. We mapped this control to the grips, which proved a terrible idea when many people clenched their hands too tightly on the controllers and reset their progress. This definitely needs to be changed to one of the front facing buttons that can't be accidentally clicked to avoid the problem.

The highlight of the entire process was definitely when a team came in to record the progress of teams but ended up focusing on our little group. They recorded a quick demo and then asked Tom and Alix to have an interview about the project, module and course as a whole. On top of this, they asked if they could return throughout the year to document our progress over the entire course of the project lifespan, which has definitely increased the pressure to produce a strong product!

One key bit of advice we received from module leaders was to that we can use dev kit mechanics to reduce our workload, especially if the mechanic is fiddly or takes a long time to produce. This advice was especially designed to address the issues we had with our teleport mechanics, so using a prebuilt version from steam VR kits will be much easier and allows us to focus on the more pressing features of the game. Next week we plan to design a few extra levels and get to work on them before the Christmas holidays.
