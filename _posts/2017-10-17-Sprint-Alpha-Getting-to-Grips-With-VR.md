Before we could start programming with the HTC Vive we needed to get a feel for how the system worked, which to our pleasure meant playing a variety of games. This helped us to understand how each of the different controls can be used in a variety of ways and what a new user would assume each to do, before they've even learnt the controls for a game. For example if a game involving firing a gun then the user will automatically pull the trigger or if presented a bow and arrow, they'll notch the arrow and pull back, then release the trigger to fire.

Keeping this in mind, we reserved specific controls for specific actions, such as grab on trigger and movement on touchpad, and then assigned other actions to whatever was left or left them available for future ideas.

The main achievement this week was Sam already achieving a replay system that, when activated, resets the user to the original spawn and then shows a copy of them doing everything they just did. So if the player spawned in, moved forward, picked up a cube and then threw it, activating the replay would show a 'Ghost' of the player recreating those exact actions.

It's a huge relief that this was achieved so easily as we expected it to be very difficult and time consuming. Having a rough version finished already means we can move ahead with other ideas much sooner and gets us off to a blazing start.
