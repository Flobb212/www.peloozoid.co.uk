Today was when our little team came together as Peloozoid Labs! Our three team members joined up with a simple project briefing: make something cool. After seeing previous years projects and realising that the most well remembered go above and beyond to make something amazing, we decided we wanted to join this club and brainstormed crazy ideas to see which would stick.

We toyed around with a few concepts before the idea of a playback mechanic popped up. It was suggested in the sense of an editor tool where someone could play a game and then watch the play-through back from an outside perspective. This 'Ghost' perspective would allow the user to view the game differently and even record trailers or different style videos to the original perspective. The target audience would mainly be game developers as the tool would allow them to make more cinematic videos of their game.

After talking about the reply idea, focus shifted from an editor tool to implementing it in a game instead. For bonus brownie points, we wanted to use something extra instead of just a computer game so decided we'd take on the challenge on working in VR. Queue a planned time for playing many VR games in the near future!
