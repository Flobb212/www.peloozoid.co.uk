Already a lot of progress has been made in terms of our project direction! We've decided on what our project is going to be and started working towards developing our company profile.

<!--excerpt-->

The project idea is going to be coined: 'Multiplayer; but single-player'. The concept is that the player enters into a room with some form of puzzle in front of them. In order to solve the puzzle, the player has to use a mechanic that plays back their previous actions.
For example, if a ledge is too high to reach but there is an object on the floor that the player can carry, they must hold the object by the ledge, then activate the play back mechanic. the player will then be teleported back to the start of the level, but a 'Ghost' will walk off and copy the exact previous actions of the player! This will allow the player to climb onto the object the ghost is now holding by the ledge and hence finish the level.
