With another demo on the horizon, focus shifted to perfecting the MVP for before Christmas, which involved making the final 2 puzzle mechanics and then tidying up the levels we had made.

Alix spent the week making pressure plates and populating the levels he'd made previously, hooking up puzzles to activating objects and the elevator doors.

Tom spent the week making the lasers and updating the GDD ready for submission. To go with the lasers, Alix also created mirror objects that could have a script attached to them depending on how the lasers worked. For a video demonstration of the laser mechanic, see the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUC9Jm_FWnw).

Sam spent his time polishing the game and ironing out bugs and problems when they arose, which was regularly with the amount we ended up tying together. The demo is tomorrow on the 6th where we'll collect feedback and take note of any technical issues, using them to make improvements for over the Christmas holidays.
