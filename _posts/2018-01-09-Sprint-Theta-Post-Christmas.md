It's been over a month since the last post and that's down to a little thing called Christmas. Over the holidays the team has been separated and required to work over Discord to manage tasks and progress. With the lack of the Vive being at hand, certain work couldn't be tested until yesterday which made for an excellent day of bug fixing. This being perfectly timed since the third and final demo is tomorrow with the final hand in only 6 days time!

Over the holidays each team member had his tasks to do:

Alix spent his time creating more models for the game including the level select pnuemo tube and a headset for the character model.

Tom wrote a script and voice recorded it to play throughout the game, along with also creating other audio such as elevator ping and object noises.

Sam improved the replay system and fixed many bugs involving the objects and movement system.
