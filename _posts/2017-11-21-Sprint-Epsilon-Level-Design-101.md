After jumping back into action with the project, our team decided that planning out the levels we'd like for our final hand in would give a good roadmap of remaining goals and progress.

Originally we wanted to pace the player by introducing a mechanic, then giving them multiple puzzles focusing on it that increase in difficulty. However due to the limited time frame for the project, we've decided to plan out 7 levels that throw our ideas out just to show what we can do and have planned, with extra levels being added if time permits. This does have the sad effect of quickly showing a mechanic before throwing it to the side to introduce another but we agreed showing off as much as we could was better than a final project with multiple levels yet only two or three actual mechanics!

So far the levels cover everything from: replay, buttons, pressure plates, lasers and mirrors. We felt this was a good variety to include as a base level with the option to create more if time permits. The last level is essentially a final test that takes everything the player has learnt and brings it all together in an extra large room which makes it seem more satisfying to end on than just another new mechanic level.

The next few weeks will focus on building these new levels and mechanics and hopefully ending up with a system where we can easily drag and drop everything to make multiple levels quickly.
