This last week has essentially been a mad dash to make everything as functional and pretty as possible for the upcoming 'Demo or Die'. This is where other people on the module and module leaders try out what we have so far and do their best to break, I mean test, our project.

Most of the things we needed to sort out involved bugs in the mechanics we had so far, but we did still add a few more things to make the experience smoother. This involved a few issues with the level loading system throwing a hissy fit if the users hand entered the pneumo-tube on adding the canister and hooking it all up to the new elevator system. The elevators work by being the secret loading room to transport players from one level into the next and prevents ruining the immersion by removing any actual loading screen. As a player enters the 'End' elevator on one level, it gets moved to the 'Start' position of the next level with the player inside, giving the impression the simple went up or down with no breaks.

Our custom movement system is also still a little buggy so we plan to see how users handle it and try to resolve the issues post demo based on their feedback.
