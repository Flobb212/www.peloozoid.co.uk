Our Beta sprint was a huge step forward in both game development and social aspects. Firstly we now have a multitude of social media accounts! You can find links at the bottom of the page and follow us on: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Reddit and even YouTube.

After the success of last week, our next objective was to work out what sort of movement system we would use. From our Vive testing last week, we experienced plenty of different styles, some of which worked well and others... not so much. A game called 'Hotdogs, Horseshoes & Hand grenades' had a very clever system whereby the user can turn the back of a controller towards themselves and a little menu pops up. This had things like options and resetting the level on it but also a variety of movement systems to choose from.


Some worked better in certain levels than others but a few of the more physically exertive ones were definitely not right for our game as after 10 minutes you needed a sit down and a cup of tea. In the end we chose to use teleportation where the user points at a spot on the ground and appears there. To see why, check out Sam's paper:  [Reducing Motion Sickness in VR](Sickeningly-Immersive.pdf) for more info on this.

Thinking about the opening menu for the game, we wanted to maximise the amount of interactivity the user has with the VR system. So instead of just a simple menu they click through to select levels, the idea of interacting with objects in a hub level was far more appealing. We agreed on an idea where there's a pneumo-tube(imagine the pipes in Futurama) in the corner of the room and the player has to pick up and insert an object into this tube to load up the corresponding level. We've already managed to create a simple version where depending which of two canisters is inserted into a box, access to a specific level will be allowed. It's a little rough around the edges and has a few bugs but with the core mechanic nailed, polishing it shouldn't take too long.
