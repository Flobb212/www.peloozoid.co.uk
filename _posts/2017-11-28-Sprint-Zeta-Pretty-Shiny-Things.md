This week we achieved a lot of different things between the 3 of us, which has put us in a great position for the next demo. With another week to go we feel really confident about showing of a great product, which hopefully the next blog should reaffirm!

<!--excerpt-->

The first thing we achieved this week was Sam importing the SteamVR package and learning how the different mechanics provided all worked. The core thing we wanted to use was the movement system, since trying to make our own proved very difficult to do well. The package had many movement variations but we finally chose the arcing movement since it was what we initially wanted and after testing, we realised it could be restricted to stop players reaching certain points and teleporting onto particular objects.

Meanwhile Alix made waves by creating the layouts of the levels we planned last week. This means now each one just needs the puzzle mechanics added and then hooked up together, which should be simple with how we've designed everything to work. He also started texturing things to make them look more appealing and give the game some actual life, rather than just bland different coloured objects.

Tom spent the week working on actual puzzle mechanics such as the pressure plates, laser beams and mirrors. Completion of these meant we should have everything we need to populate levels and then easily create new ones by coming up with a new puzzle and sticking pieces together like Lego.

The last thing we thought up were more developments to the story. The initial idea was that the player is a spy, infiltrating a facility to steal something. Up to this point we hadn't thought of anywhere more to take the direction, but we now have the concept of the player stealing a time warp device. After they steal the device, it can be used in the Pneumo-tube to access different themed levels such as medieval forest, Egypt and futuristic worlds. At the moment these ideas are definitely a stretch goal with no close desire to produce and add them, given the amount of work we already have.
